# Masquerade
Code Louisville Front-end project# MasqueradeCode Louisville Front-end projectI created this website as part of the marketing for TARC's Metro United Way campaign. As of right now it is more of a Save the Date page until the planning details have been decided. At this time, I just want to provide something clean and simple for advertising.  It will grow as the details of the event are planned.
Also, the links are active, but aren't linked to any styled pages.  They are linked to a not available, comeback soon link.
To see this page, you only have to run it.
